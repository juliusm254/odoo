This module enables contracts management with recurring
invoicing functions. Also you can print and send by email contract report.

It works for customer contract and supplier contracts.

Contracts are shown in portal.

Configuration
=============

To view discount field in contract line, you need to set *Discount on lines* in
user access rights.

Contracts can be viewed on the portal (list and detail) if the user logged into the portal is a follower of the contract.

Usage
=====

#. Contracts are in Invoicing -> Customers -> Customer and Invoicing -> Vendors -> Supplier Contracts
#. When creating a contract, fill fields for selecting the invoicing parameters:

   * a journal
   * a price list (optional)

#. And add the lines to be invoiced with:

   * the product with a description, a quantity and a price
   * the recurrence parameters: interval (days, weeks, months, months last day or years),
     start date, date of next invoice (automatically computed, can be modified) and end date (optional)
   * auto-price, for having a price automatically obtained from the price list
   * #START# or #END# in the description field to display the start/end date of
     the invoiced period in the invoice line description
   * pre-paid (invoice at period start) or post-paid (invoice at start of next period)

#. The "Generate Recurring Invoices from Contracts" cron runs daily to generate the invoices.
   If you are in debug mode, you can click on the invoice creation button.
#. The *Show recurring invoices* shortcut on contracts shows all invoices created from the
   contract.
#. The contract report can be printed from the Print menu
#. The contract can be sent by email with the *Send by Email* button
#. Contract templates can be created from the Configuration -> Contracts -> Contract Templates menu.
   They allow to define default journal, price list and lines when creating a contract.
   To use it, just select the template on the contract and fields will be filled automatically.

* Contracts appear in portal to following users in every contract:
