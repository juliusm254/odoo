This module allows you to manage agreements, letter of intent and contract content.
The module is meant to be used by the legal team of a company and to allow them
to define sections, clauses and templates with their respective content that can
be dynamic.

Based on the template, an agreement can be created and the pdf document generated.

The agreement would go through a workflow to finally become a contract with the
customer signature.
