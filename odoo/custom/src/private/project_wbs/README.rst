Adding WBS information to Odoo Projects

* The hierarchy of a project is considered the WBS
  (Work Breakdown Structure)
* The analytic accounts in the project hierarchies are considered WBS
  components
* The analytic account code is shown in the project
* The complete WBS path code is shown in the analytic account and in the
  project
* The complete WBS path name is shown in the analytic account and in the
  project
* The WBS paths are concatenated with each other

Searching and Browsing WBS

* It is possible to search projects by complete WBS path code & name
* It is possible to search tasks by project complete WBS path code & name
* The WBS components can be classified as project, phase, deliverable,
  work package.
* The classification is shown in the project and analytic account views
